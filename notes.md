- [Ghidra symbol table detection](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/Ghidra/Features/GnuDemangler/ghidra_scripts/VxWorksSymTab_Finder.java)
- [Blackhat talk](https://i.blackhat.com/asia-19/Fri-March-29/bh-asia-Zhu-Dive-into-VxWorks-Based-IoT-Device-Debug-the-Undebugable-Device.pdf)

## Thoughts

Ghidra and blackhat seem to agree on three fields:

- Symbol name (4 byte pointer)
- Symbol address (4 byte pointer)
- Symbol type (4 byte pointer?)

Other fields also seem to exist depending on the version.

## Plans

- Explore the VS code extension. The VSIX package can be obtained [here](https://windriver.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/windriver/windsdksupport/2.5.4/1656760967976/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage). It is just a zip file.
- Try to buid a binary with symbols.
- Maybe setup VXWorks on Raspberry Pi.
